## Summarise data (20 points)

``` r
Data %>%
        count(EU) %>%
        mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ##      EU     n  perc
    ##   <dbl> <int> <dbl>
    ## 1     0  9338  40.7

Based on this sample, the majority of UK voters should have voted to
Remain in the UK in the 2016 Referendum, which, of course, did not
happen. One reason for this error in prediction could be the percentage
of missing responses (which, in this sample, amounts to nearly 11%). It
is also likely that, because the data collection spanned 3 years, the
opinions of some sample members changed since their initial vote in the
Referendum. But the sampling technique used in this study could be to
blame; participation is completely voluntary, time-consuming, and
necessitates the ownership of a residence/phone/internet/etc for
completion. Therefore, it is probable that the sample is not entirely
representative of the UK, which could explain the difference between the
studyâ€™s findings and the actual result of the Referendum.

## Summarise data by sex and age (30 points)

``` r
Data %>%
        group_by(sex, agegr) %>%
        summarise(
          propLeave = mean(EU == 0, na.rm = TRUE) *  100, 
          propRemain = mean(EU == 1, na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 
          totalLeave = sum(EU == 0, na.rm = TRUE),
          totalRemain = sum(EU == 1, na.rm = TRUE)
        )
```

Based on this sample in Great Britain, it appears that women and men
aged 16-25 were most likely to have voted to remain in the EU, with
women generally expressing a greater likelihood of voting to remain in
all age groups. However, age and voting to leave the EU seem to be
positively correlated, meaning that those aged over 70 tended to choose
to leave, with older men showing consistently greater interest in
leaving than older women.
